# Membership

Internal tool to propose new members, remove inactive members, and modify full/part-time weights via PR and private discussion. Will only match [public docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html) ~1x per quarter when the split is updated.

### Adding a new member

An existing member should make a PR to this repo with team, name (+ link to work), and time-weight

- Any new additions should have been contributing **at least 6 months** before being proposed
- use a single PR per person
- share the link to the PR in the PG discord membership channel so other members are aware

Include the following in the comment:

- Name / identifier
- Team
- Link to some work
- Short summary of their work / eligibility
- start date of relevant projects
- proposed weight (full or partial)

Discussion should be open for ~1 week to give members time to review and contribute to the discussion. This can be either with üëç / üëé, but also ideally some writing on why you think the proposed member fits the eligibility or not.

### Remove an Existing member or Update Weights

- if the individual under consideration is not making the PR themselves (eg. from a team member or collaborator), please have them acknowledge the change on the PR or in the Discord
- use a single PR per person
- share the link to the PR in the PG discord membership channel so other members are aware
