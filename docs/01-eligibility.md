# 1. Eligibility

Protocol Guild eligible efforts must:

- Champion Ethereum's ethos of decentralization, credible neutrality, censorship resistance and permissionlessness 
- Be fully open source under an Open Source Initiative (OSI) [approved License](https://opensource.org/licenses)
- Have a regular presence in Ethereum R&D or governance venues like [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch), [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/), [protocol calls](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y191cGFvZm9uZzhtZ3JtcmtlZ243aWM3aGs1c0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) (e.g. AllCoreDevs, breakouts, testing/interop, etc.)
- Be engaged in feature prototyping (e.g. [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/eips), devnets, etc.)
- Be centered on the strictly necessary and existential software required to produce blocks and advance the chain (eg. MEV boost and light clients are omitted here as they are not required for local block production and are not implicated in consensus activities). This includes the coordination work to test and roll out the software to the ecosystem as part of network upgrades.

Eligible projects must also target at least one of the following projects/areas related to Ethereum core protocol upgrades, maintenance and development:

| Description | Repos/Projects |
|:--|:---|
| Work on the canonical protocol specs. <br/> Should be implementation agnostic + unopinionated | - [Consensus specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) <br/> - [Execution specs (EELS)](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) <br/> - [Execution APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis)  |
| Ethereum mainnet Execution and <br/> Consensus client implementations. <br/> Must be well-tested, technically differentiated, <br/>  and have production-ready releases <br/> (ie. ability to construct full blocks locally) | - [Erigon](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon) <br/> - [EthereumJS](https://github.com/ethereumjs) <br/> - [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) <br/> - [Grandine](https://github.com/grandinetech/grandine) <br/> - [Hyperledger Besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu) <br/> - [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) <br/> - [Lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar) <br/> - [Nethermind](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind) <br/> - [Nimbus CL](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2) <br/> - [Nimbus EL](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1) <br/> - [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) <br/> - [Teku](https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku) <br/> - [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) |
| Client testing/security/infra <br/> which supports these implementations | - [ethereum/tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) <br/> - [ethereum/execution-spec-tests](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests) |
| Network upgrade coordination  | - [ethereum/pm](https://github.com/ethereum/pm) |
| Research and implementation experiments <br/> related to potential protocol changes | - [Verkle trees](https://github.com/gballet/go-verkle) (Verge) <br/> - [Portal Network](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs) (Purge) <br/> - [Ipsilon](https://github.com/ipsilon) (EVM Improvements) <br/> - Consensus work <br/> - Cryptography <br/> - Mechanism design <br/> - Resource pricing |
| Protocol Guild | - Fundraising <br/> - Research/testing of future improvements <br/> - Internal maintenance of membership <br/> - General communications |

## 1.1 Context

The eligibility framework is a "best effort representation" of Ethereum Layer 1 R&D. It tries to be sufficiently accommodating to what is the core protocol, but not any broader. This framework has been modified previously and will likely continue to be: more restrictive in some places and more permissive in others.

Contributing to the efforts referenced above does not guarantee Protocol Guild membership. While this list tries to be explicit when possible linking to specific repositories, there are some research areas which can't be linked to a single source and may still be considered eligible.

Formal organizational affiliations are not necessary for membership. It may be the case that some members of an organization will be eligible but others will not be.

Independent or unaffiliated contributors are considered by the same guidelines as any contributors "officially" part of teams/projects.

## 1.2 How to Modify the Framework

Changing the eligibility framework can be made through a PR to the [documentation repo](https://github.com/protocolguild/documentation). This PR should add the project in the appropriate section, along with the following info:

- Name of project
- Eligibility start date for the project
- Summary of why this project should be considered eligible/ineligible

The eligibility start date for the project is the date at which the project met the Eligibility criteria above. This is the earliest date that future Protocol Guild members can use to count contributions towards the project.
