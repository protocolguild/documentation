# Protocol Guild

This is a new public goods funding mechanism: a split contract which distributes donated application tokens over a vesting period to a self-curated list of Ethereum protocol contributors. The primary goals: to provide autonomous tools for recruitment, retention, and reward to the protocol and its maintainers.
