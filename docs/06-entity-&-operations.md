## 6.2 Finances

Protocol Guild's legal entity currently receives 2% of split proceeds to Safe multisigs:

- Mainnet
    - [0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B) (current address)
    - [0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99) (previous address)
- Optimism
    - [0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=oeth:0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B)

The entity converts all tokens on a monthly basis to maintain a stablecoin reserve. This covers:

- $200k in reserve for 2 years of fixed + variable costs incurred to operate the entity
- $100k in reserve for potential insurance claims against the foundation 
- Stable base compensation for independent Operations contributors
    - $12.5k/month ($150k/year) to support cheeky-gorilla's ongoing full-time contributions

Generally, the entity should receive sufficient funding to cover the above, but not accumulate beyond that. These amounts are set by the membership, as noted in the [Governance](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-membership.html#governance) subsection of the docs.
